## About the Video Course
Whether you have no programming background or have some experience with JavaScript but admit that you struggle with advanced JavaScript coding or feel intimidated when you come across “weird” JavaScript concepts such as Closures, Encapsulation, or IIFE, this is the course for you! 

This course follows a robust structure and a result-driven approach based on “learning by doing”, which has helped our students secure web development jobs in the past. It is the most comprehensive JavaScript course in the market. With 21 highly structured sections distributed over 30 hours plus of content and 227 lectures, including crystal-clear presentations, detailed explanations, coding challenges, and a complete professional real-life project. 

In this course, you will go from a beginner to a job-ready JS Developer. We will prove that concepts like closures, hoisting, IIFE, encapsulation, and more are as easy as drinking a glass of water. And you will gain so much power you will use those "weird" concepts to build a fully functional 10h Typing Test App which will make you proud of yourself. 

By the end of the course, you will have built a full professional JavaScript project from scratch: a fully functional typing test application that can test users’ typing speed and generate a PDF certificate at the end of the test.
